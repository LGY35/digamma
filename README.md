# Digamma
The implementation of [DiGamma: Domain-aware Genetic Algorithm for HW-Mapping Co-optimization for DNN Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11220.pdf).

The implementation is integrated in [GAMMA](https://github.com/maestro-project/gamma). For more detail please look at [GAMMA-PE-Mapping-Co-Exploration](https://github.com/maestro-project/gamma/tree/master/src/GAMMA/#advanced-usage-pe-mapping-co-exploration).
